The purpose of this webpage is to allow Middlebury students to create, view and search for events that are happening on campus. It was made by students, for students. Anyone with a valid Middlebury email can create an account, and those with the 'administrator' password have the power to approve events created by other students.

Access to the website can be found at http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~mwinkler/calendar.php

A more detailed write-up about the project can be found in a document titled "MiddCalWrite-up.docx"
